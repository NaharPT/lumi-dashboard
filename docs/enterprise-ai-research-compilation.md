## Sequoia Capital: The $1T Opportunity to Build the Next Amazon

**Source:** https://sequoiacap.com/article/ai-retail-opportunity/ (Author: Konstantine Buhler, Aug 14, 2025)

### Core Thesis
U.S. retail generates over **$7 trillion** annually. AI represents the next transformation capable of creating a **$2+ trillion** opportunity comparable to Amazon's impact.

### Eight Historical Retail Tech Transformations

1. **Manufacturing (1770s-1800s):** Steam engine + cotton gin -> mass-produced goods
2. **Public Railways (1825-1830):** Department stores (Macy's 1858, Au Bon Marche 1852)
3. **Rural Railroads & Telephony (1870-1920):** Mail-order retail (Montgomery Ward, Sears)
4. **Cash Registers (1879-1906):** Chain stores (Woolworth's, J.C. Penney)
5. **Automobiles (1908-1960):** Shopping malls (Southdale Center 1956)
6. **Microprocessors & Supply Chain (1974+):** Big-box stores (Walmart, Costco, Home Depot)
7. **World Wide Web (1989-2000s):** E-commerce (Amazon, eBay)
8. **Mobile Devices (2007-2013):** On-demand economy (Instacart, DoorDash)

### Five AI-Era Retail Manifestations

**1. Consultative Purchasing**
- AI's superpower: analyzing complex info and answering expert questions
- Home improvement example: Home Depot ($350B market cap) remains brick-and-mortar due to consultation needs; AI could disrupt
- Similar: supplements, nutrition, travel, clothing, health advice

**2. MCP Servers (Native Checkout)**
- Chat platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, Perplexity) as new operating systems
- MCP servers become "native apps"
- Transactions completed directly within chat interfaces

**3. Predictive Shipping**
- Ship products proactively; charge only if kept; return unsold items next day
- Starting point: dry goods and staples (paper towels, toilet paper)

**4. The Roaming Store**
- Autonomous vehicles (Waymo, Tesla Robotaxi) as mobile storefronts
- Historical parallel: ice cream trucks

**5. Computer Vision Predictive Shopping**
- In-home sensors detect low inventory, auto-reorder
- Calendar integration for events; recipe formulation from available ingredients

# 10. Merck KGaA Pipeline Research

**Note:** This refers to **Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany)** -- NOT Merck & Co / MSD (USA). These are entirely different companies.

**Research Date:** 2026-02-18

---

## Company Overview

Merck KGaA is a science and technology company operating across three sectors: Healthcare, Life Science, and Electronics. Its Healthcare division (EMD Serono in North America) focuses on oncology, immunology, neurology, and fertility. The company has been accelerating its pipeline through internal R&D, strategic acquisitions (notably the $3.4B SpringWorks Therapeutics deal), and multi-billion-dollar licensing partnerships.

---

## Pipeline Table by Phase

| Phase | Drug / Candidate | Target / Indication | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Approved (recent)** | Ogsiveo (nirogacestat) | Desmoid tumors | FDA-approved 2023 (via SpringWorks); under EMA review |
| **Approved (recent)** | Gomekli (mirdametinib) | Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) | FDA-approved Feb 2025; first-ever NF1 treatment; under EMA review |
| **Phase 3 / Filed** | Xevinapant | Head and neck cancer | IAP inhibitor; key late-stage asset |
| **Phase 3** | M9241 (NHS-IL12) | Solid tumors | Immunocytokine; combination oncology |
| **Phase 3** | Evobrutinib | Multiple sclerosis | BTK inhibitor; ongoing after earlier setbacks |
| **Phase 3** | Atacicept | IgA nephropathy / lupus | TACI-Ig fusion protein; immunology |
| **Phase 3** | Cladribine (Mavenclad) | Multiple sclerosis | Approved; label extension studies ongoing |
| **Phase 3** | Various oncology combos | Multiple solid tumors | 18 positive Phase 3 readouts in 2025; 21 new Phase 3 studies enrolling |
| **Phase 2** | M8891 | Solid tumors | EIF4A inhibitor; novel mechanism |
| **Phase 2** | M3258 (elerexfio) | Multiple myeloma | XPO1 inhibitor |
| **Phase 2** | RNA-targeting molecules | Neurological disorders | Skyhawk collaboration; up to $2B in milestones |
| **Preclinical** | Multiple undisclosed | Neurology, oncology, immunology | Skyhawk partnership generating novel RNA modality assets |

## Key Therapeutic Areas

### Oncology (Primary Focus)
- Largest pipeline segment: rare tumors (desmoid, NF1), head & neck cancers, solid tumor immunotherapy
- SpringWorks acquisition ($3.4B) added two approved assets and rare-tumor platform
- Xevinapant is the most advanced internal oncology candidate
- ~80 Phase 3 studies running simultaneously

### Neurology
- Mavenclad (cladribine) -- marketed MS anchor product
- Evobrutinib (BTK inhibitor) -- Phase 3 for MS
- RNA-targeting small molecules via Skyhawk partnership

### Immunology
- Atacicept in IgA nephropathy and lupus (Phase 3)
- TACI-Ig mechanism targeting B-cell survival pathways

### Fertility / Endocrinology
- Long-standing franchise: Gonal-f, Pergoveris, Cetrotide (mature marketed products)
- Stable revenue base, not active pipeline candidates

### Rare Diseases
- Expanded via SpringWorks: desmoid tumors and NF1 now established rare oncology franchises

## Recent Updates (2025-2026)

| Date | Event |
|---|---|
| 2025 | Completed SpringWorks Therapeutics acquisition for $3.4B |
| Feb 2025 | Gomekli (mirdametinib) receives FDA approval for NF1 |
| 2025 | Skyhawk Therapeutics multi-billion dollar RNA therapy partnership (up to $2B milestones) |
| 2025 | 18 positive Phase 3 readouts; 21 new Phase 3 studies initiated; ~80 Phase 3 ongoing |
| Ongoing | Ogsiveo and Gomekli under EMA review for European approval |
| Ongoing | Evobrutinib and Atacicept Phase 3 trials progressing |

---

## R&D Strategy Summary

- **Rare/specialty oncology pivot:** SpringWorks = high pricing power, lower competition
- **RNA modality expansion:** Skyhawk partnership for next-gen drug class in neurology
- **High-volume Phase 3 portfolio:** ~80 concurrent studies maximizing near-term approval probability
- **Dual-geography execution:** US approvals pushed through EMA without additional clinical spend
- **Acquisition-led de-risking:** Acquiring approved/de-risked assets rather than building everything internally
- **R&D investment:** Scale of activities (80 Phase 3 studies, $3.4B acquisition, multi-billion licensing) indicates billions annually
